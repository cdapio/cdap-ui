 * row is nested under.
 *
 * The context provides a way to broadcast state changes on the siblingline. Stage changes
 * happen if user hovers over the line to see the hierarchy with immediate parent.
 *
 * In this case the provider broadcasts the current hovered parent-sibling line and that gets highlighted.
