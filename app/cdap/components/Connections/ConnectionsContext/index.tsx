/**
 * The Connection Mode represents how the connections will be integrated across the UI.
 *
 * 1. Routed - Regular use of Connections under the /connections route. This is entirely in React
 * so we can use regular react-router and navigation can take place just normal
 *
 * 2. Routed Workspace - Meaning routing only happens while navigating to the workspace. This is the
 * case when user is in dataprep table and clicks on the left arrow to browse through connections.
 * The user is already in a specific workspace (/wrangler/:workspaceid) and we don't want to change
 * the url based on the activity in the connection
 *
 * 3. In Memory - The entire routing happens in memory. This will be the case when the user clicks on the
 * "Browse" button in wrangler sources or clicks on the "Wrangle" button in wrangler transform. Since we are in
 * studio (completely in angular world) we do not want to do any navigation here. Everything happens in memory,
 * including browsing through connections, going to a wrangler workspace, and finally applying the wrangler properties
 * to wrangler transform.
