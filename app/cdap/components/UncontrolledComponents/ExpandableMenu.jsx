  This is a direct copy paste from reactstrap's source. There is only one reason to do this.
  We can't upgrade reactstrap to 4.* yet as it has upgraded to bootstrap that defaults to flexbox
  now and we can't make that change at this point in the release. So this artifact stays here until we have
  upgraded reactstrap.
